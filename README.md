Python-MP3Encoder - This is still BETA
====================

Why I wrote this?
-----------------

There are many MP3-Encoder out there, but no one which keeps the directory structure the same
while recursivly encoding MP3-Files with constant Bitrate or VBR.

How to use it?
----------------
#### Linux:
Make lame executable: chmod +x lame

#### Gui Mode:

* Need Tkinter module installed

Windows:
* Not tested yet

Linux:
* run "python threaded_gui.py"

#### Console Mode:

Windows:
* Look in start.bat to see how to execute this in cmd mode

Linux:
* run "python Encoder.py /home/user/Music/ /home/user/Encoded_Music/"

Comming soon:
-----------------
* Python-Code compiled to Windows Executable(".exe")
